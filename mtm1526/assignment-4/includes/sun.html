It is almost perfectly spherical and consists of hot plasma interwoven with magnetic fields.[11][12] It has a diameter of about 1,392,000 km, about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass (about 2Ã—1030 kilograms, 330,000 times that of Earth) accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.[13] Chemically, about three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen, while the rest is mostly helium. The remainder (1.69%, which nonetheless equals 5,628 times the mass of Earth) consists of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron, among others.[14]</p>
